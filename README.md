Establishing three layer architecture to improve interoperability in Medicare using smart and strategic API led integration
Noticeable contributionshave been made in healthcare sectors for improving data interoperability, or "data liquidity," as needed. But there still is more work to do to get to a fully interoperable system Recently, the demand has shifted from collecting data to generating knowledge, conclusions and actions. The amount of collected data in the healthcare industry has grown in such a way that stored electronic health records (EHRs) had an explosion in the last decade[3]. EHRs are no longer used to store basic patient information and administrative tasks, as they once were, but they may now include a variety of data, such as the medical history, laboratory results, demographics, medication and allergies, immunization status, radiology images, vital signs. Individual providers and healthcare institutions are the custodians of this data today and it is sitting in databases with few employed use cases[1][2].The relevance of interoperability in reaping the full benefits of digitalization in healthcare and medicine is demonstrated in this research. Although its significance has been recognized, there is still an awareness gap among healthcare professionals[3][4].We can safely disclose these data points and make them accessible to healthcare industry stakeholders and public alike through an API marketplace, enhancing industry efficiency and allowing population health technology innovation[5][6][17].An API has a documented protocol set that describes the communication way between computers or applications. APIs acts as an intermediator to ensure easy and secured data transfer between application and server.[8]
Use:We use this framework where system APIs are decentralizing access of back-end systems and process APIs are aggregating the system APIs and isolating business logic from System APIs. Experience APIs unlocking data for front-end applications and it focus on data representation for different channels.Healthcare payer organisations may address strategy creation, data curation and management, patient access API administration, implementation and support, and consent management with comprehensive interoperability solutions. Payer organisations can better engage their members, compete more successfully in their markets, and undergo a digital transformation by improving healthcare information sharing in addition to complying with the CMS final rule requirements.

One of the most significant challenges facing the healthcare industry in the digital age is interoperability. At the present, electronic health records (EHRs) including the medical history of the patient, laboratory tests, demographics, medication and allergies, immunization status, radiology images, vital signs allare hidden in isolated databases, incompatible systems and proprietary software, whichcreates biggest obstacles to data exchange, analyze, and interpret.Healthcare sector is realizing the thrust of a system which allows healthcare facilities to access, analyze, and enhanced communication between systems, medical devices, and applications at a local or cross-organizational level.Application Programming Interface(API) integration has become the most popular solution for managing the flow of data between internal applications, EHRs, and other data exchange tools in the healthcare industry by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely.In this paper, we suggest that interoperability is a must for most of the upcoming medical advancements.Among various examples of emerging technologies likeIoT, SaaS and cloud computing, APIs are the best tool in order to maximise the performance in terms of earning more income, better understanding their customers, etc.The paper highlights the benefits  of API and suggests a framework of API led integration to improve the interoperability of patient health information between healthcare organizations while maintaining the privacy and security of data.
Conclusion: Today, several popular healthcare-specific APIs based solutions are helping organizations to achieve their outcomes. Indian healthcare organizations are also adopting APIs during the past few years for not only interoperatability but  also to offer secure electronic information transfer between health IT systems and third-party apps, it also has significant hazards and weaknesses.To get a fully interoperable system, however, more work must still to be done.The proposed framework provides a comprehensive set of capabilities and services that benefit all stakeholders while also exceeding user privacy and consent expectations. API are not only serving as patient centric solution, but various technological innovations can also waived together to provide powerful and integrated solution to help various stakeholders of the medical sector like AI and Big Data.By referencing the proposed framework, we can easily Integrate any ERP, CRM, Ecommerce Store, Marketplaces, Shipping and POS Systems under one platform to automate the process.
